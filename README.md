# BlockchainBlue
A BLE-based IoT gateway simulator that is decentralised with the use of a basic blockchain implementation. This design takes a chain of devices that communicate with eachother through BLE. Each device contains a server-cleint model for Bluetooth application to communicate. A copy of a predefined blockchain is stored within each device that will be used to simulate consensus protocols that can simulate a decentralised IoT gateway.
